# maverick-file-system

Assignment 4 for CSE3320 OS

This assignment was to recreate the functionality of a file system using an inode structure. It reuses the shell from the first assignment to execute the commands. It is able to create multiple images of filesystems, and swap between them. It can move files to and from the computer onto these images, and if saved, will be preserved after the program is closed. It can delete files, and can be undeleted if their data was not overwritten.

This program was designed to run in a linux docker
